# ATS v2 Migration Changelog

## PR-ATS2-00 — Prototype Freeze & Characterization

### BEFORE
Repository prototype existed without a durable ATS v2 migration record.

### DURING
- baseline SHA frozen at `198b182e89124224be426ed22b915bec77da1bb6`
- current product contract documented
- characterization cases defined
- executable baseline evidence created
- tests/checks executed (`npm ci` passed after `node_modules` cleanup; `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run dev` all passed)
- failures discovered: Initial execution failures were caused by a corrupt local `node_modules` cache on Windows, not by invalid repository dependencies.
- scope/non-goals recorded
- G0 evidence requirements formalized

### AFTER
No production behavior is intentionally changed by PR-ATS2-00.

Gate status:
`G0 REPRODUCIBLE_BASELINE — PASS (Repository successfully builds, lints, typechecks, and runs after a pristine clean install)`

Next authorized iteration after G0:
`PR-ATS2-00B — Trust Containment`.
